  - Regular security audits

## Bias and Discrimination

### Algorithmic Bias
AI systems often perpetuate and amplify existing societal biases:

- **Sources of Bias**:
  - Historical data reflecting societal prejudices
  - Underrepresentation in development teams
  - Limited testing scenarios
- **Real-world Examples**:
  - Facial recognition failures with certain ethnicities
  - Gender bias in recruitment algorithms
  - Discriminatory lending practices
- **Impact Assessment**:
  - Employment opportunities
  - Criminal justice decisions
  - Healthcare access

### Training Data Issues
The quality of AI training data significantly affects system fairness:

- **Historical Data Problems**:
  - Incomplete records
  - Outdated social norms
  - Systematic exclusions
