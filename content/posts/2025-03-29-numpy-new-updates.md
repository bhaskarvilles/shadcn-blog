# Proposal to Extend NumPy Broadcasting for (D₁, D₂, ..., N, M) → (D₁, D₂, ..., K, M) When K is a Multiple of N

# Proposal: Enhancing NumPy's Broadcasting Mechanism

## **Current Broadcasting Rule and Its Limitation**  
As per NumPy's current broadcasting rules, if two arrays have different shapes, the smaller array can be expanded **only if one of its dimensions is 1**. This allows memory-efficient expansion of data without copying. However, if a dimension is greater than 1, NumPy **does not** allow expansion to a larger size, even when the larger size is a multiple of the smaller size.  

### **Example of Current Behavior (Allowed Expansion)**
```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2, 3]])  # Shape (1,3)
B = np.array([[4, 5, 6],    # Shape (2,3)
              [7, 8, 9]])

C = A + B  # Broadcasting works because (1,3) can expand to (2,3)
print(C)
```
**Output:**
```
[[ 5  7  9]
 [ 8 10 12]]
```
Here, `A` has shape `(1,3)`, which is automatically expanded to `(2,3)` without copying because a dimension of size `1` can be stretched.

However, NumPy fails when trying to expand a dimension where `N > 1`, even if the larger size is a multiple of `N`.

### **Example of a Case That Fails (Even Though It Could Work)**
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],    # Shape (2,3)
              [4, 5, 6]])

B = np.array([[10, 20, 30],  # Shape (4,3)
              [40, 50, 60],
              [70, 80, 90],
              [100, 110, 120]])

C = A + B  # Error! NumPy does not allow (2,3) to (4,3)
```
This fails with the error:
```
ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (2,3) (4,3)
```

## **Why Should This Be Allowed?**
If a larger dimension is an exact multiple of a smaller one, then logically, the smaller array can be repeated along that axis without physically copying data—just like NumPy does when broadcasting `(1,M)` to `(N,M)`.

In the above example:
- `A` has shape `(2,3)`, and `B` has shape `(4,3)`.
- Since `4` is a multiple of `2` (`4 % 2 == 0`), `A` could be logically repeated `2` times to become `(4,3)`.
- NumPy already does a similar expansion when a dimension is `1`, so why not extend the same logic?

## **Proposed Behavior (Expanding N → M When M % N == 0)**
Allow an axis with size `N` to be broadcast to size `M` **if and only if** `M` is an exact multiple of `N` (`M % N == 0`). This is just as memory-efficient as the current broadcasting rules because it can be done using stride tricks instead of copying data.

### **Example of the Proposed Behavior**
If NumPy allowed this new form of broadcasting:
```python
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],    # Shape (2,3)
              [4, 5, 6]])

B = np.array([[10, 20, 30],  # Shape (4,3)
              [40, 50, 60],
              [70, 80, 90],
              [100, 110, 120]])

# Proposed new broadcasting rule
C = A + B  
print(C)
```
**Expected Output:**
```
[[ 11  22  33]
 [ 44  55  66]
 [ 71  82  93]
 [104 115 126]]
```
This works by logically repeating `A` to match `B`’s shape `(4,3)`.

## **Why This is a Natural Extension of Broadcasting**
- **Memory Efficiency:** Just like broadcasting `(1,M)` to `(N,M)`, this expansion does not require physically copying data. Instead, strides can be adjusted to logically repeat elements, making this as efficient as current broadcasting.
- **Intuitiveness:** Right now, broadcasting already surprises new users. If `(1,3)` can become `(2,3)`, why not `(2,3)` to `(4,3)` when `4` is a multiple of `2`? This would be a more intuitive rule.
- **Extends Current Functionality:** This is not a new concept—it extends the existing rule where `1` can be stretched to any value. We are generalizing it to any factor relationship (`N → M` when `M % N == 0`).

## **Implementation Considerations**
The logic behind NumPy’s current broadcasting already uses stride tricks for memory-efficient expansion. Extending it to handle `(N, M) → (K, M)` (where `K % N == 0`) would require:
- Updating `np.broadcast_shapes()`, `np.broadcast_to()`, and related functions.
- Extending the existing logic that handles expanding `1` to support factors as well.
- Ensuring backward compatibility and maintaining performance.

## **Conclusion**
I strongly believe this enhancement would make NumPy’s broadcasting more powerful, more intuitive, and just as efficient as before. The fact that we can implement this without unnecessary copying makes it a natural extension of the existing feature.
