## **Announcing My Candidacy for the OWASP Global Board of Directors**

[OWASP GLOBAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS 2024 ELECTIONS](https://owasp.org/www-board-candidates/2024/bhaskar_ram_allam)

I am excited to officially announce my candidacy for the OWASP Global Board of Directors! With over a decade of experience in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and full-stack web development, I am passionate about advancing software security and expanding OWASP's impact in the ever-evolving landscape of emerging technologies. 

### **My Journey in Technology and Security**

As the founder and leader of **Kerdos Infrasoft Pvt Ltd**, I’ve had the opportunity to focus on innovations in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence, while working closely with some of the leading organizations in tech, such as the **Linux Foundation, Hyperledger, OWASP**, and **OpenAI**. Through these collaborations, I’ve developed a deep understanding of the critical importance of security in these technologies. 

I’ve also contributed to several open-source projects, including **NumPy 2.0.0**, which showcases my commitment to community-driven development. Additionally, I’ve launched **SecretCoder.org**, a platform designed to teach secure coding practices and cutting-edge technologies to developers worldwide. These efforts reflect my long-standing dedication to promoting secure software practices on a global scale.

### **Why I'm Running for the OWASP Board**

OWASP is a cornerstone of the global software security community, and I believe it has a vital role to play in securing the future of digital technologies. My candidacy is driven by a desire to ensure that OWASP continues to lead the way in the field of software security—especially as new technologies, such as blockchain and artificial intelligence, become more prevalent.

If elected to the OWASP Global Board of Directors, I plan to focus on three key areas:
1. **Enhancing OWASP’s presence in emerging technologies** – I will work to create comprehensive security frameworks for blockchain, decentralized networks, and artificial intelligence, ensuring that OWASP stays ahead of security challenges in these fields.
2. **Increasing community engagement and participation** – I aim to foster greater involvement within the OWASP community by launching mentorship programs, organizing hackathons, and forming partnerships with key industry players. Community-driven growth is essential for the long-term success of OWASP’s mission.
3. **Advocating for stronger collaborations with global tech organizations** – As technologies continue to converge, OWASP’s partnerships with major tech organizations will be key to expanding its influence. I will work to strengthen these relationships to ensure OWASP remains a leader in secure software development.

### **My Vision for OWASP’s Future**

Over the next three to five years, I envision OWASP leading the way in setting security standards for decentralized and AI-driven technologies. These are the future of digital systems, and OWASP can play a pivotal role in defining how these technologies are built securely from the ground up.

My goal is to expand OWASP’s reach, both in terms of projects and global impact. I believe OWASP should prioritize quality over quantity when it comes to projects—focusing on high-impact initiatives that will benefit both traditional software development and new technologies like cloud security and AI. 

### **Join Me on This Journey**

I am eager to contribute to OWASP’s continued success and would be honored to represent the global community as a board member. I believe that my background in artificial intelligence, blockchain, and secure coding practices uniquely positions me to make meaningful contributions to OWASP’s mission.

If you are a member of OWASP, I would be grateful for your support and your vote in the upcoming election. Together, we can ensure that OWASP remains a driving force in the software security community and continues to expand its influence into the exciting and evolving world of emerging technologies.

**Thank you for your support!**
